    /**
     **Experimental.** Capture every HTTP request made through `configuration`, and show it in the
     inspector next to your analytics events. The shape of this API may change in a minor release.

     ```swift
     let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default
     Snoop.installNetworkInterceptor(on: configuration)
     let session = URLSession(configuration: configuration)
     ```

     What it does not see, because `URLProtocol` cannot: `URLSession.shared` (its `protocolClasses`
     is not configurable), WebSockets, background sessions, and any session a third-party SDK builds
     for itself. And because the request is replayed through Snoop's own session, **your
     `URLSessionDelegate` is not consulted for intercepted requests** — certificate pinning or a
     credential you would have supplied in `didReceive challenge:` does not run, and the connection
     falls back to the system's default trust evaluation. That is no weaker than not intercepting at
     all, but it does drop a check you added; if you rely on one, leave that configuration alone.

     Installing on a second configuration replaces this configuration's options: the interceptor
     keeps one set of settings for the process, so the last call wins.

     Both closures are held until the next call — in practice for the life of the process — so
     capture `[weak self]` if one reaches into an object you expect to be deallocated.

     - Parameters:
       - maxContentLength: bodies past this are captured truncated and flagged in the viewer.
       - redactHeader: redact matching headers. `Authorization`, `Cookie` and `Set-Cookie` are
         always redacted on top of this.
       - redactQueryParameter: redact matching query parameters in the captured URL. Common
         secret-bearing names (`api_key`, `token`, …) are always redacted on top of this.
       - redactBody: rewrite a captured body preview before it is stored.
       - keepRequest: capture a request only when this returns true.
